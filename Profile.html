  <h1> <b>About me </b> </h1>
  <p> Teacher, Web developer and Graphics designer </p>
<div>My name is IRFAN. I was born on the 17th of October in 1997, which means I am 21 years old now. I have got 2 siblings, Eldest and elder brothers. Then I have got my mother and father too. I'm mostly close with my eldest, as he's the only big I have. However, I do love my brothers too and make the most of it whenever I am with them.
 
I have been living and studying in Chittagong until I was in 5th class (10 years old).I finished off my high school and took 5 years in RHCCHS, then I moved back to college again. I have started in 'College life' at PUC  and I was finish off with some great grades and then I plan to study Higher education or University in National University of Bangladesh(BBA-hon’s)  at Department of Management. The field I am thinking to study in is Management. Bangladesh is a great country with great opportunities, so I will have no doubt, when it’ll finish it blessing life for me in this country.</div>

<div>I love learning and I have always taken curious topics very seriously. I have never said to anyone in my life, that 'I hate Learn'. Many people find me as a great personality, but I only see that as a compliment rather than an insult. I have got big dreams, when it comes to studies. Since I was 6 years old, I decided to be an IT expert. So that is my goal and I always try to aim to do my best at anywhere, so hopefully my hard work will pay off in the end. I don't really know why I decided to be an IT expert. I just love Technologies. Although I do feel very sorry whenever I see the poor technologies in there, but just the fact that we have got capital to cure people is a great thing. Caring for people has always been my desire. Whenever I see someone, who I think need careless or help, I am always willing to help them.
 
Some interests I have got are; reading books, playing, watching movies, cooking and praying.</div> 
<br>I love to read books, because books can always be true friends. They never demand neither do they complain. This is the way I look upon books. Mostly I read Quran. Currently I am reading a novel called "Principles of accounting".
 
Moving on favourite movies; Titanic, Romeo & Juliet, Crash, Twilight. Basically the list can go on and on. I must be up to date with the latest movies.</br>
 

</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Cooking has been a huge interest of mine. My mom's a great cook- especially in Asian cooking. I think I have got it from her. From my point of view, having learned how to cook, makes a person life much easier.
 
Then last but not least I love praying. I pray as much as I can. Being a Muslim and not praying, just doesn't go together, so that is why I pray. I also feel that whenever I pray, it helps me getting forward and achieving more and more.</p>

	  <div> Tutors fill a different role than teachers and parents, and that puts them in a unique position to support students. Personal relationships are foundational to student success -- the more connected a student feels to his or her tutor, the more the tutor creates trust and respect, essential ingredients for students to learn well.

      <h5 class="card-title">Graphics Designer</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Graphic design, also known as communication design, is the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content. The form it takes can be physical or virtual and can include images, words, or graphics. The experience can take place in an instant or over a long period of time. The work can happen at any scale, from the design of a single postage stamp to a national postal signage system. It can be intended for a small number of people, such as a one-off or limited-edition book or exhibition design, or can be seen by millions, as with the interlinked digital and physical content of an international news organization. It can also be for any purpose, whether commercial, educational, cultural, or political BY IRFAN..</p>

Some will argue with me, but I’ll fight this battle and dig in because I know content before website design is the right approach. I believe: Strong website design extends past colors, fonts, and layout boxes. Strong design focuses on the user. Website design should be crafted around the user, their needs, and the desired outcome of a website visit. It should be ...</p>
